          On the westernmost tip of the Island of Flores sits the town of Labuan
          Bajo. It lies peacefully, with many wonders waiting for you to
          explore. Labuan Bajo was only a small fishing site, but flourished to
          become the gateway to many exotic destinations in East Nusa Tenggara.
        </p>
        <p>
          The extraordinary interest among travelers lies in Komodo Dragons or
          locally called ora. It is a valuable alluring factor, showcased in its
          superb national park.
        </p>

          The Komodo National Park was listed as UNESCO’s World Heritage Site in
          1991. Both on land and underwater, it is home to fascinating wildlife.
          The park consists of Komodo Island, Rinca Island, Padar Island, and

          Labuan Bajo is known as the city of sunset. You can find plenty of
          out-of-this-world scenic views of the spectacular sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some interesting destinations that you can discover inside
          the city. The Mirror Cave is located only 4 kilometers away from
          Labuan Bajo. It is said that Dutch archaeologist, Theodor Verhoeven,,
          who believed Labuan Bajo was once located underwater, founded this
          cave in 1951. The local name for the cave is Goa Batu Cermin. You can
          see the reflective stones shine at you in some parts, hence, the name
          “Goa Batu Cermin.” It translates to “stone mirror cave.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Have you ever swam in a cave-lake before? Here’s a chance to try it in
          Rangko Cave. Nestled in Ranko Village, this natural wonder presents
          its blue water and sunlight shining directly towards its cave lake.
          Their stalagmites will surely amaze you as well.
        </p>

          You can also explore the paths to Cunca Rami and Cunca Wulang canyon
          waterfall!
